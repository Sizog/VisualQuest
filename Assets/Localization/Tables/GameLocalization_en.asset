    m_Localized: This hulk, with its appearance and especially the smell, eloquently
      reminds us that the scavengers' strike in the city has not stopped for several
      weeks.

  - m_Id: 2455611932672
    m_Localized: You arrived at the scene to interview the owner of "Club 54". Despite
      early time, your case does not tolerate delay - the offender is still at large
      and, perhaps, is now choosing a new victim. The car in an empty parking lot.
      Club 54 is a hundred meters down the road.

    m_Localized: You approach the "Club 54". The establishment is closed today, but
      its bright signs, as if designed to annoy you, still work. You need to find

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 31594985324544
    m_Localized: You knock on the door with all your might. Just a little more, and
      it will fly off the hinges. But this does not bring any result - there is silence
      outside the door. There is a handwritten sign on the door "We're closed today.
      Our waitress was murdered. FUCK OFF!"

      Maybe the owner of the club is there. You need to get his attention somehow.

    m_Localized: As if all those ugly signs on the walls weren't enough for them,
      they put another one up on the roof of the building. Amazing. Just wow.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: 'The light turns on in the room, and a sleepy, disheveled man appears

      your legs are still intact. I''m armed," he shouts at you.'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 41691237089280
    m_Localized: The owner of the club is about to lose his patience. "Listen buddy,
      I don't know who you are or what you want, but you should be the FUCK out of
      here while you're still alive." You understand that, as luck would have it,
      you forgot your police badge somewhere. Without it, it is unlikely that it
      will be possible to have a normal conversation with the owner.

    m_Localized: 'The light in the windows gives you mixed feelings: peace and some
      kind of envy. Someone is now relaxing or having fun instead of looking for
      something useful in the dirty back alley of a third-rate club.'

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 53395790528512
    m_Localized: Seeing the police badge, the owner changes his anger to mercy. "Please
      catch the freak who did this! I'll tell you everything I know." Then the owner
      of "Club 54" answers all your questions in detail.
